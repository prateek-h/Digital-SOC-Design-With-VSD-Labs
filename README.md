# Digital-SOC-Design-With-VSD-Labs
The NASSCOM-VSD SoC Design Program aimed to provide training and certification in Digital SoC Design.Digital System-on-Chip (SOC) design is a fundamental aspect of modern electronics engineering, facilitating the integration of various digital components onto a single chip.
### Benefits
1.Crafting and characterizing standard cells.

2.Gaining practical experience in the Physical Design domain.

3.Generating a complete GDSII from an RTL netlist.

4.Diving into and enriching the open-source EDA landscape.

# DAY 1: S1 Inception of open source EDA Openlane and Sky130 PDK
Introduction to QFN-48 Package,chips,core,die and IPs
Pads are components that allow us to transmit a signal inside the chip, Core is the location of all fixed logic gates presentand Die is the entire chip's size.

## RISC-V
RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. Unlike most other ISA designs, RISC-V is provided under royalty-free open-source licenses. Many companies are offering or have announced RISC-V hardware open source operating systems with RISC-V support are available, and the instruction set is supported in several popular software toolchains.
## Process of Software application to hardware

The above image shows how the process converting a program that is needed to be run is carried out
1)The 'C' language program is converted to a Instruction set by the OS in a .exe file .

2)The assembler present in the system only understands the instruction language.

3)The assembler then converts this instruction set to binary code as the hardware only has binary inputs to function.
